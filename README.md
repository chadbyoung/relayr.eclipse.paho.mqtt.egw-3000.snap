# Paho.MQTT - Dell Edge Gateway - Relayr

This will be an WIP where I try to create an eclipse.paho.mqtt snap that will
read the ambient temperature inside of a Dell Edge Gateway 3001 using the 
onboard ST Micro HTS221 temperature sensor and then publish that temperature
to a Relayr cloud instance.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
